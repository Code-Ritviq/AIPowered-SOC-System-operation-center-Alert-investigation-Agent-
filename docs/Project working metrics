Title: AI-Powered SOC Alert Investigation & Automation Pipeline
Author: Ritviq Sharma
Category: Enterprise Agents (SOC Automation / Cybersecurity)
________________________________________
1. Executive Summary
This project is a fully automated Security Operations Center (SOC) AI system built using a chain of specialized agents. The system takes raw security logs and processes them through:
1.	Enrichment Agent – gathers additional threat intelligence
2.	Triage Agent – assigns risk scoring and severity
3.	Recommendation Agent – suggests appropriate security actions
4.	Reporting Module – generates final actionable output
This project simulates a real-world SOC system and fulfills “Enterprise Agents” category by demonstrating the use of autonomous agents in automating cybersecurity workflows.

2. Problem Statement
Modern SOC teams face:
•	Too many alerts
•	Not enough analysts
•	Slow manual triage processes
•	Lack of consistent investigation steps

This project solves these by automating:
	Threat Intelligence Lookups.
	Severity Scoring.
	Response Recommendations.
	Report Generation

Using a chain of autonomous agents.

3. Solution Overview (Architecture)
The solution consists of three AI agents performing sequential tasks.
3.1 Enrichment Agent
•	Enhances logs with mock threat intelligence (IP reputation, Domain reputation, Malware Hash reputation)
•	Adds GeoIP information
•	Produces an “enriched” log object
3.2 Triage Agent
•	Applies a weighted scoring formula
•	Outputs a triage score
•	Assigns severity category (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
3.3 Recommendation Agent
•	Based on severity + enrichment results
•	Suggests real-world SOC actions
•	Examples:
o	Block IP
o	Isolate endpoint
o	Monitor activity
o	No action
3.4 Pipeline Runner
•	Executes all agents in sequence
•	Processes top-N alerts
•	Exports final results

4. Dataset Description
The project uses a synthetic dataset representing SOC alerts with fields:
•	timestamp
•	src_ip
•	dst_ip
•	domain
•	hash
•	event_type
•	severity
These logs resemble:
- Firewall Alerts
- IDS/IPS Events
- EDR Detections
- Malware Hash Matches

5. Detailed Agent Logic (Explained Simply)
5.1 Enrichment Agent
Adds extra information:
•	IP Risk Score (0–100)
•	Domain Risk Score
•	Hash Malware Score
•	GeoIP Country
Uses deterministic hashing to convert an IP into a repeatable risk value.
5.2 Triage Agent
Calculates risk like this:
final_score =
    ip_risk * 0.6 +
    domain_risk * 0.2 +
    hash_risk * 0.2
Then severity is assigned:
•	0–20 → Low
•	21–50 → Medium
•	51–80 → High
•	81–100 → Critical
5.3 Recommendation Agent
Rules include:
•	If malicious hash → isolate host
•	If high IP risk → block IP
•	If suspicious domain → activate phishing workflow
•	If low → monitor traffic

6. Results & Outputs
Final output CSV includes:
•	timestamp
•	src_ip
•	dst_ip
•	country
•	ip_risk
•	domain_risk
•	hash_risk
•	triage_score
•	severity
•	recommended_action
